The Authors Guild argued this violated copyright law, while Google claimed it was transformative and beneficial for research and education.

Oracle, the owner of the Java API, claimed copyright infringement, stating Google’s use was not transformative.

Sony argued the device had substantial non-infringing uses, such as time-shifting (recording programs for later viewing).

Cox argued that her statements were protected under the First Amendment, claiming she was acting as a journalist. The court ruled against Cox, holding that she could not invoke journalist protections because she failed to demonstrate that her posts adhered to established journalistic standards, such as fact-checking and accuracy. The decision underscored that online publishers, including bloggers, can be held liable for defamation if they make false statements of fact without meeting the standards applied to traditional media.",
